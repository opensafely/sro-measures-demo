# SRO Measures Demo

This study is a step-by-step walk-through of the OpenSAFELY framework, using the Service Restoration Observatory (SRO) Measures study as a guide.

* Released outputs are in the [released outputs folder][].
* If you are interested in how we defined our variables, then take a look at the [study definition][];
  this is written in Python, but non-programmers should be able to understand what is going on there.
* If you are interested in how we defined our codelists, then take look in the [codelists folder][].
* Developers and epidemiologists interested in the framework should review the [OpenSAFELY documentation][].
